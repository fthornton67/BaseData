        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Kneel on a mat with your knees hip-width apart, hands grasping the ab wheel handles, arms directly beneath your shoulders. Angle the wheel so that it points toward the left corner of the mat in front of you. Keep your back flat and your abs engaged (belly button pulled up and in away from the floor).</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE: Roll the wheel toward the left corner of the mat as you lower your hips toward the ground so that your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. EXHALE: Using your abdominals and obliques, slowly roll the wheel back in until you reach the starting position to complete one rep. Finish several repetitions on the left side (pictured) to complete one set. Switch sides and repeat on the right side (not pictured).</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Keep your arms straight and your shoulders away from your ears at all times. Only roll as far forward as you can while still maintaining good form. Do not allow the hips to drop toward the floor or the lower back to arch. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Abs, Obliques</i></span>
