        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Lift one leg out in front of you. Slowly lower your body on one leg, bending at the hip. Come down a little bit at first to get use to the motion. Once you feel comfortable, slowly lower yourself to a comfortable position. Don’t exceed 90 degrees at the knee. Return back to the starting position without bringing your raised leg down to the floor. Keep your back as upright as possible.  Start out with only 1 set but work your way up to 2 sets, 10-12 repetitions for each leg.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Keep weight on your heels. Don’t let your knees extend over the plane of your toes. This is an intermediate exercise, but you have to be very careful when you’re lowering your body. Because you’re lowering your body weight onto one leg, it’s important to lower yourself slowly.  When first learning this exercise you can try going part way down, using a second wall (near a corner), or using your other foot as an aid when necessary.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads</i></span>
