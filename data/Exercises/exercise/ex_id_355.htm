        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Make sure the balance board is an appropriate distance in front of you; you should be able step onto it and lower into your lunge without your forward knee coming past your toes, and without leaning forward from the waist. Practice caution when stepping on and off the board for each lunge. Take your time. Make sure the balance board is resting on a surface where it will not slip. Try to step onto the very top center of the board to help you balance more easily. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Glutes, Abs</i></span>
