        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Place your balance board a few feet in front of you. Stand tall with your legs together, arms at your sides, toes pointing forward, abs engaged, back straight and shoulders relaxed. Step onto the balance board with your right foot and find your balance, keeping your abs engaged, shoulders relaxed, and back and legs straight.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE: Bend both knees to lower your hips straight down toward the floor without leaning forward. EXHALE: Push back up from your lunge to return to the start position and complete one rep. Repeat all reps on one leg then switch sides. </span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Make sure your feet are spaced appropriately; you should be able to lunge down without your forward knee coming past your toes, and without leaning forward from the waist. Take your time throughout this exercise so that you can move in a controlled manner. Make sure the balance board is resting on a surface where it will not slip. Try to step onto the very top center of the board to help you balance more easily. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Glutes, Abs</i></span>
