        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Starting Position</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Begin by standing tall (not pictured) with your legs hip-width apart, arms extended in front of your shoulders, and one foot on top of a balance board. Make sure your knees and toes are pointed in the same directly (either forward, not pictured, or slightly turned out, as pictured). Engage your abs and place an equal amount of weight in both feet.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE: Push your hips back (as if sitting into a chair behind you) and bend your knees to squat down. EXHALE: Straighten the legs and push your hips forward to return back to the starting and shift your weight into the balance board while abducting your opposite leg out to the side. INHALE: Place lifted foot back onto the floor and lower back into your squat (both knees bent). EXHALE: Push back up out of your squat to return to the start position and complete one rep. After one set, switch the balance board placement to the other side to perform another set.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Master the "Staggered Squat on Balance Board" and "Single Leg Standing Balance with Abduction" before trying this exercise. Only squat as far as you can while maintaining balance and control. Keep your abs engaged and use a focal point in front of you to aid your balance. Try to keep the balance board as stable as possible. Keep chest lifted and minimize any forward leaning (while squatting) or lateral leaning (while abducting your leg).<BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Outer Thighs, Abs</i></span>
