        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Begin by lying on your back with a resistance band wrapped around your feet.  The band should be snug around your feet, but not too tight.  Lift your legs off the ground so they are perpendicular to the floor.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Keep your legs straight (but not locked) and spread your legs apart pushing against the resistance band.  Go out (wide) about as far as you can without putting too much strain on your lower back. Slowly release to bring your feet back together.  Try doing 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Make sure to push out just as much with your non-dominant leg as your dominant leg – keep it balanced.  You can spread your arms out to your side, palms down or near your buttocks to help with balance and lower back strain.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Outer thigh, Hips</i></span>
