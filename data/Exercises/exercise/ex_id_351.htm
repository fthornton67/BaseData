        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Slowly and cautiously step onto the balance board, one foot at a time, holding on to a wall or sturdy object for balance if necessary. With both feet on, take your time adjusting your balance until you can stand upright with legs together, back straight, abs engaged, and arms extended in front of your shoulders.</span> <br/>

        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE: Push your hips back (as if sitting into a chair behind you) and bend the knees to squat down. EXHALE: Straighten the legs and push your hips forward to return back to the starting (standing) position to complete one rep.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Only squat as far as you can go while maintaining balance and control. Keep your abs engaged and use a focal point in front of you to aid your balance. Try to keep the balance board as stable as possible, and be sure to balance your weight evenly between both feet. Keep chest lifted and minimize any forward leaning.<BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Abs</i></span>
