      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Try to keep your legs together and your feet on the floor at all times. Lengthen through your back (spine), and engage your abs (pull your belly button toward your spine) at all times. Keep your shoulders relaxed. <br/><br/>Make it harder: Instead of crossing your arms at your chest, extend them up next to your ears. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Abs</i></span>
