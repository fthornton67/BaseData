        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Begin by sitting on top of the Swiss ball. Roll in the direction your head is pointed until your lower back is supported by the curve of the ball. You can either cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your ears.  Do not put them behind the head or clasp them together behind your head.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">EXHALE:  Crunch forward, using your abdominals, until you are at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ball. Keep you neck in a neutral position. <br/><br/>INHALE:  Lower yourself back to the starting position, where your head wraps back around the ball.  Try doing 2 sets of 15 crunches.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Keep space in-between your chin and chest, so your spine stays in a neutral position.  Balance yourself on the ball with as much upper body weight off the ball as possible without falling over backwards.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Abs</i></span>
