        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Twist a large towel so that it is in a long straight line.  Step onto one end of the towel with your right foot, grasping the other end of it in your right hand (palm facing down arm at right side).  Keep feet slightly apart, knees slightly bent.</span> <br/>

        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Allow enough tension to feel resistance as you raise your right arm up, approaching a parallel line with the floor.  Hold at 45 degrees for 30 seconds.  Adjust tension (step further away from hand) and hold arm parallel to floor for 30 seconds.  Switch sides and repeat for one set.</span> <br/>

        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Adjust resistance by stepping closer (more difficult) or away (easier) from you’re the end of the towel in your hand.  You should feel enough resistance during each part of the exercise (may need to adjust it by stepping further away from hand at each different angle mentioned).  Be sure not to hold breath.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Shoulders</i></span>
