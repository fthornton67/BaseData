        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Kneel in front of the ball. Place your hands atop the Swiss ball and bring your feet off the ground. Bring your navel in toward your spine. Walk your hands out on the ball, moving both the ball and your arms away from your body. Once you feel your abdominal muscles working, you are in the starting position.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Your hands should stay stationary on the ball. Pivot from your knees, bringing your torso and hips forward as the ball rolls away from your knees. Keep moving until your chest drops down, keeping your chest as upright as possible, without hyper extending your lower back. Keep your spine in a neutral position. Hold the furthest position comfortably for a couple seconds and roll back to starting position.  Try doing 2 sets with 10-12 repetitions.</span> <br/>
