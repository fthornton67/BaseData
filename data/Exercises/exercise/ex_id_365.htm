      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Master the "Single Leg Standing Balance with Knee Lift" exercise before trying this. Only lift your leg as high as you can while maintaining balance and control. Try to keep your standing leg straight and your back flat at all times. Do not lock out your knees. Engage your abs and stare at a focal point in front of you to help with balance. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Abs, Hips</i></span>
