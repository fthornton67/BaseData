        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Starting Position</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Slowly and cautiously step onto the balance board with one foot, holding on to a wall or sturdy object for balance if necessary. Take your time adjusting your balance until you can stand upright with your opposite leg lifted (knee bent), back straight, abs engaged, and arms extended in front of your shoulders (pictured).</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE: Keep your lifted leg still as you push your hips back and bend the knee on your balancing leg to squat down. EXHALE: Straighten your balancing leg, pushing your hips forward to push up to the starting position to complete one rep. Finish several repetitions on the this same leg (pictured) to complete one set. Switch sides and repeat on the opposite leg (not pictured).</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Only squat as far as you can go while maintaining balance and control. Keep your abs engaged and use a focal point in front of you to aid your balance. Try to keep the balance board as stable as possible. Keep chest lifted and minimize any forward leaning. It's OK to lower your lifted foot to the floor to adjust your balance throughout this exercise, if necessary. <BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Abs</i></span>
