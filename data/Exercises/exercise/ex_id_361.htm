	Single Leg Standing Balance with Isometric Knee Lift</b></span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Starting Position</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Slowly and cautiously step onto the balance board with one foot, holding on to a wall or sturdy object for balance if necessary. Take your time adjusting your balance until you can stand upright with your other leg foot lifted off the floor, abs engaged, and arms extended at your sides. From there, slowly lift your knee up in front of you until the thigh is approximately parallel to the floor and the knee is bent at about 90 degrees (pictured).</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Breathe steadily as you balance in this standing position for 15-30 seconds. Gradually work your way up to holding this exercise for 1-3 minutes for an isometric core challenge. Switch sides.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Master the "Single Leg Standing Balance on Board" exercise before trying this. Try to keep your standing leg straight and your back flat at all times. Do not lock out your knee. Engage your abs and stare at a focal point in front of you to help with balance. <br/><BR/>Make it harder: As you get better, try to lift your arms higher instead of extending them at your sides. The higher your arms are lifted (such as next to your ears), the more challenge you'll add to this exercise.<BR/><BR/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Abs, Hips</i></span>
