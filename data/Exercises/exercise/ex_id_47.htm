        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Begin by sitting on top of the Swiss ball with your feet firmly planted on the ground.  Keep your abdominal muscles tight and hold dumbbells to the side of your head, palms facing away from your body, and elbows at 90 degrees.</span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Action</b></span> <br/>
        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">EXHALE:  Raise dumbbells slightly in front of your head and above your head until you touch the ends of each dumbbell together. Your arms should be as straight as possible and you should not lock your elbows.  <br/><br/>INHALE:  Bring your arms and the dumbbells back down to the starting position.  </span> <br/>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">If you feel pinching in your shoulders as you raise the dumbbells, bring the dumbbells more out in front of your head.  Keep your spine straight and continue to look forward during the exercise.  Performing this activity in front of a mirror will help you with your form.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Shoulders</i></span>
