        <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">INHALE:  Slowly lower your body and remember to bend slightly at your hips.  Keep your weight back on your heels and your back as upright as possible. Make sure your knees don’t cross the plane of your toes.   <br/><br/>EXHALE:  Straighten legs and come up to the starting position to complete one rep.   </span> <br/>

        <span style="font-size:14px; color:#5a5ab5"><b>Special Instructions</b></span> <br/>
      <span style="font-size:11px; color:#000000">Do not go past 90 degrees at the bend in your knees because this causes additional stress on your joints. If you feel pain in your knees, just go down to where you don't feel pain and come back up. If you have difficulty performing this exercise you can also use a chair or wall to help with balance and the movement until you build sufficient strength.<br/><br/><i><b>Muscles Worked:</b> Quads, Glutes</i></span>
